# Long-Term Prototyping Project

_This project can be done as a team or as an individual. _

**Prompt 1: Future Utopia/Dystopia**. Imagine our civilization _at least_ 20 years from now. Things have either collapsed beyond repair or life has become a harmonious dream. Through some crazy combination of wormholes and string theory, you have the opportunity to create a piece of information that will be sent back to the current population.

**Prompt 2: Real World Issue**. Is there a present-day, real-world issue you want to address? What is the issue? Who is affected by the issue? Who would be affected by your potential solution? How would they be affected by your potential solution? What are the existing solutions out there? How will your prototype potentially improve upon the existing solutions?

* What does your imagined future \(Prompt 1\) or real context \(Prompt 2\) look, sound, and feel like? \(your framing **story**\)
* Who is your potential audience, and what **message** would you transmit to them\(either from the future, or from the present\)? 
* You will brainstorm, research, sketch, map, design, and build **physical prototypes of an object\(s\)** from your imagined future.
* You will also create a** Bibliography **of 5 resources you used as you prototyped. This bibliography should be in MLA format but does not need to be annotated. Resources can include how-to guides, research articles or books on your topic, interviews with potential users, etc.
* You will deliver your message in any final **medium\(s\)** you choose. The only requirement is that it includes image\(s\), physical or virtual model\(s\), or video\(s\) of your prototyped physical object\(s\).

I suggest brainstorming one or more of the following themes to get you started, but you will need to eventually drill down from these very broad themes to specificity:

* Animals
* Commerce
* Education
* Engineering
* Ethics
* Information
* Materiality
* Media: Moving Image, Photography, Painting, Print, Sound, etc.
* Memory
* Nature
* Networks
* Ruins
* Science
* Sexuality
* Systems
* The Object
* Technology
* Time
